Description: This lab demonstrates how to use event delegation to handle events efficiently by attaching a single listener to a parent element instead of multiple child elements.
It focuses on using event.target, closest(), and matches() to safely identify and control specific elements in the DOM. Each exercise applies delegation to real UI patterns including
an accordion, dynamic tag builder, filterable grid, and inline edit list. The project also practices proper Git branching and clean, maintainable JavaScript code.
